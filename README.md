# OpenGLProject

A simple project built with OpenGL and GLFW, using CMake for cross-platform compilation. This project will allow us to learn OpenGL and render different objects.

## Features
- OpenGL rendering with GLFW for window/input management.
- Modular structure with separate `src/`, `lib/`, and `assets/` directories.
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows).

## Prerequisites
Youâ€™ll need OpenGL, GLFW, CMake, and a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) installed.
